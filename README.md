# real-time-stock-trading
Lock-free stock order matching system in C++ using atomic operations and multi-threading. The simulation creates a fixed-size order book, where multiple threads concurrently add randomly generated buy and sell orders. After orders are submitted we match buy orders with sell orders based on defined criteria.
